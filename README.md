# Vocab Teacher using Giphy

Angular 2 Firebase application for learning a new language using the help of the Giphy API.
Hosting it on GitHub Pages doesn't work with authentification, so downloading it is necessary to try the application.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
